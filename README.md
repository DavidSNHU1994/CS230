Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a server-based program that is designed to be played on multiple platforms. This includes, Windows, Linux and MacOS. The Client found success with their with game Win it or Lose it. They wanted to expand their portfolio to multiple operating platforms and reach a wider audience.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think that i did well in being clear and concise in conveying what needed to be said in the document. I also think i did well in figuring out the storage and memory for the program so that it can function efficiently and be able to allocate memory appropriately to ensure the application is properly optimized.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped keep a clear vision of the project and of what needed to be done on the program. It kept ideas within scope without creating any overhead that would have needed to be trimmed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the part about the servers/clients when it comes to the Operating Systems. I feel i could have dived in more to the strength and weaknesses of each operating system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I think using a user story would really help in figuring out how the user want's to implement the design. It can give the context needed and allows you to much more closely match the vision needed for the program.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approach it with a plan. I make sure i have the documentation and that the vision of the employee is being conveyed properly befoer even starting with programming the application
